  <p>
    Hi 👋, my name is Tom Wiesing and I am a <em>Software Engineer</em>.
    I focus on building reliable, well-tested software and infrastructure in a pragmatic way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I studied Applied Mathematics (and later Data Engineering) at
    <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacobs University</a> <small>(now constructor university)</small>.
    I was always torn between mathematics and computer science.
    I was deeply involved in building and operating campus and alumni software systems.
    I worked on production services such as a
    <a href="https://github.com/BeyondThePond/jay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">student (and now alumni) voting</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/BeyondThePond/MemberManagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alumni management</a>, as well as a
    <a href="https://github.com/OpenJUB/dreamjub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">student search engine</a>.
    These systems were all used by a highly international student body from hundreds of countries.
    That experience shaped how I think about software early on: systems need to be reliable, understandable, and resilient, because they serve people with very different expectations and constraints.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After my bachelor's and master's, I spent several years in academia and completed a PhD <small>(and finally switching to computer science formally 😀)</small>.
    My dissertation is titled <q>Towards A Commons Of Object-Centered Research Data</q> and has DOI
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.25593/open-fau-1825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>10.25593/open-fau-1825</code></a>.
    Alongside my research, I worked as a software engineer and helped introduce modern development practices into my research group, including proper version control, automated testing, continuous integration, and reproducible build pipelines.
    The goal was to treat research code as long-lived software rather than throwaway prototypes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today, I consider myself a software engineer first.
    I currently work at the <a href="https://www.cdi.fau.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAU Competence Center for Research Data and Information</a>.
    I enjoy working close to the code, improving how teams build and maintain systems, and reducing friction between ideas and dependable production software.
    I'm largely stack-agnostic, but my preferred programming language is <code>go</code>.
    I also work with <code>TypeScript</code> and <code>Python</code>, and regularly deal with <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>git</code>.
    I enjoy working with <code>OCI Container Images</code> and orchestrating containers using <code>Docker Compose</code>.
    For a more complete list of my coding skills and projects,
    <a href="https://github.com/tkw1536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have a look at my GitHub page</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
    In my free time I like to take long walks and continue to code.
    My personal passion project is <a href="https://github.com/tkw1536/ggman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ggman</a>, a minimalistic tool for managing my git repositories.
    I also like to <a href="https://guys.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make random websites</a>.
